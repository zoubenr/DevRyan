- Desktop: keep Electron directory and file permission requests on the OpenCode approval path while preserving native picker behavior for legacy Tauri installs.
- Chat: prevent stale completion indicators from appearing after a session starts working again, and settle stale busy/retry status only after terminal assistant turns.
- Permissions: improve auto-accept and external-directory permission handling for child sessions and resync flows with focused regression coverage.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-06-27

- OpenCode Slim: add Slim install/config helpers, managed plugin defaults, and runtime lifecycle integration so Slim-managed agents and overlays are available consistently.
- Agents: improve runtime agent overlay generation, harness preflight checks, and settings helper coverage for managed OpenCode configurations.
- Plugins: expand plugin settings state, persistence, and UI controls for installed plugin handling.
- Chat: refine retry visibility, assistant status handling, and plan lifecycle behavior with focused regression coverage.
- Model settings: strengthen model preference autosave, synchronization, hidden-model persistence, and queued-send behavior across UI state stores.
- VS Code: align OpenCode configuration handling with the web runtime and add coverage for config updates.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-27

- Release baseline: reset DevRyan versioning and release history so the current repository state is published as the new v1.0.0 starting point.
- Runtime: includes the current web, Electron desktop, legacy Tauri compatibility, and VS Code extension code from the former v1.2.0 tree.

## [1.1.12] - 2026-06-27

- OpenCode Slim: surface Slim-managed agents in Settings by composing installed agent prompts with active Slim preset/root model metadata.
- Agents: route Slim-managed model and variant overrides back to `oh-my-opencode-slim` config instead of DevRyan's sidecar.
- Runtime: preserve active plugin registrations, copy Slim config into managed overlays, and pass the active Slim preset/background-subagent flag to managed OpenCode.
- VS Code: mirror the Slim agent catalog, override routing, and runtime overlay behavior for extension-host sessions.

## [1.1.11] - 2026-06-27

- Cursor: report ripgrep usability and resolved source in runtime diagnostics, with stronger path resolution coverage.
- Chat: recover more streamed message, reasoning, reconnect, and idle-plan edge cases so transcript state settles correctly after partial or delayed events.
- Chat: strip leaked skill-announcement reasoning fragments, including orphan headings, from assistant reasoning output.
- Agents: add harness preflight checks for skill-announcement policy conflicts and refresh packaged agent defaults to use the platform tool-activity policy.
- UI: keep notification settings controls and sidebar footer/button content aligned with the current compact layout.

## [1.1.10] - 2026-06-27

- Sessions: preserve the leading status and pin gutter in animated sidebar rows so active, pinned, and child-session indicators remain visible.
- Settings: normalize hidden model references across display and execution provider IDs so split-provider models stay hidden or visible consistently in pickers and provider settings.
- Chat: show visible transcript summaries for each text-like local attachment while still sending file contents as hidden synthetic context.
- Agents: preserve selected agent instructions in Cursor plan mode while layering no-mutation constraints, and sharpen Orchestrator ambiguity and delegation guidance.

## [1.1.9] - 2026-06-25

- Sessions: hydrate sidebar child sessions for visible projects so nested sessions remain discoverable after refresh or partial sync.
- Sessions: keep child sessions without their own directory attached to the visible parent project while avoiding unrelated project bleed-through.

- Settings: protect first-run model favorite and hidden-model changes from being overwritten by stale desktop settings sync.

## [1.1.8] - 2026-06-25

- Chat: improve streaming follow behavior, timeline restoration, assistant error handling, and submit/interrupt state with expanded regression coverage.
- Sessions: tighten lifecycle indicators, active-state rendering, and queued send handling so sidebar and chat state stay aligned.

## [1.1.6] - 2026-06-24

- Desktop: clear packaged Electron HTTP and code caches on startup without deleting app storage such as cookies, localStorage, or IndexedDB.
- Reliability: force dynamic local API reads to bypass browser HTTP cache from both the server and shared OpenCode client, preventing stale session, chat, git, and preview state after updates.

- Cursor: prewarm draft sessions and worker agents before send, with expanded turn-timing marks for prewarm, provider send, and first-delta diagnostics.

- OpenCode: update the bundled SDK dependency and external runtime recommendation to 1.17.9 across web, UI, and VS Code diagnostics.
- Cursor: improve first-token latency by warming persistent worker authentication, prewarming the Cursor SDK worker during startup checks, and preserving late stream events before applying final results.
- Chat: reduce noisy assistant output by hiding redundant plan tool rows, filtering orphan narration fragments, and stripping repeated self-referential reasoning status lines.
- Skills: exclude Claude skill roots from DevRyan discovery, install location UI, and route-level skill source handling while keeping OpenCode and Agents skills available.
- Agents: tighten packaged default agent guidance for delegated specialist handoffs.

## [1.1.3] - 2026-06-18

- Chat: retry session materialization when buffered streamed part deltas remain orphaned after a server fetch, preventing text from staying hidden until the turn goes idle.

## [1.6.4] - 2026-05-20

- Cursor: improved plan-mode handling so structured plans render as plan cards even when the SDK emits the plan without an explicit marker.
- Cursor: fixed assistant streaming/status handling for multi-part responses, reasoning fragments, tool parts, and idle state after terminal messages.
- Sessions: repaired Cursor-generated titles from completed plan output instead of leaving raw prompts or placeholder titles.
- Agents: tightened orchestrator/fixer delegation rules and auto-resume behavior so delegated specialists finish with explicit terminal status.
- Skills: applied visible-skill policy to runtime agent overlays so hidden skills do not remain allowed through generated managed configs.
