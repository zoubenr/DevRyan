# packages/ui/src/lib/messages/

## Responsibility
Utilities for message shaping, formatting, and cross-component message semantics.

## Design
Pure transform helpers keep message logic reusable outside React components.
- `actionablePlan.ts` detects plan-mode prompts, explicit plan sentinels, and structured plan fallbacks.
- `planCardRender.ts` maps a resolved message-level plan split back onto rendered text groups so the card appears at the right point in mixed text streams.

## Flow
Incoming/outgoing message payloads are normalized before store insertion or render.

## Integration
Used by chat, sync reducers, and compose/send flows.
