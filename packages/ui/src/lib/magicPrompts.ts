Repo commit style:

- Use scope for focused areas: dashboard, admin, data, db, i18n, services, analytics, booking, billing, provider, professionals, components.
- Omit scope only for broad cross-cutting changes.

- Prefer verbs used in history: add, update, enhance, improve, implement, integrate, wire, standardize, simplify, remove, avoid, align.

Rules:
- do not stage, commit, pull, rebase, or push.
- subject format: <type>(<scope>): <summary>, or <type>: <summary> only when no clear scope fits.
- allowed types: feat, fix, refactor, perf, docs, test, build, ci, chore, style, revert.

    template: `You are drafting a pull request review comment that will be posted back to the PR author. You are not the implementer; do not propose to write code or run commands.

Before drafting:
- Read the PR title and body first to anchor on the author's intent. Evaluate whether the implementation matches that intent — missing pieces, incorrect behavior vs intent, scope creep.
- The PR diff is the source of truth for what changed; the repo on disk may not yet reflect those changes. Read the diff carefully. Use the repo only as ancillary context (imports, call sites, existing patterns, nearby code) when you need to verify a specific claim — not to discover the changes themselves.
- No speculation: every reported issue must be grounded in the diff plus ancillary repo evidence you actually read. If a claim cannot be verified, drop it — do not hedge or guess.
- Clarifying question: if the PR's intent itself is unreadable (title/body give no "why", diff is ambiguous on purpose), ask me one focused question about intent and stop. Do not open a discovery loop — this is a review, not a planning session.

High-signal bar — only report issues that meet all of:
- Objective and verifiable from the diff plus ancillary repo evidence.
- Introduced by this PR (not pre-existing).
- Material: bugs that will cause incorrect runtime behavior, security/privacy risks, correctness edge cases, backwards-compat breakage, missing implementations across modules/targets, boundary violations, OR a clear CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md violation where you can quote the exact rule.

Do NOT report:
- Pre-existing issues unrelated to the diff.
- Pedantic nitpicks a senior engineer would not flag.
- Issues a linter would catch.
- Subjective style preferences not explicitly required by CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md.
- "Might" / "could" / "potential" concerns without concrete evidence.
- Rules mentioned in CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md but explicitly silenced in the code (e.g., via an ignore comment or documented exception).
- Missing tests / coverage gaps unless CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md explicitly requires them for the changed area.

Validation pass: before writing the final comment, re-check each candidate issue against the diff + ancillary repo evidence. Drop anything you are not certain about. False positives waste the author's time.

Output rules:
- Produce a single review comment addressed to the PR author, using the exact format below.
- No emojis. No code snippets. No fenced blocks. Short inline code identifiers are fine.
- Reference evidence with file paths and line ranges (e.g., path/to/file.ts:120-138) derived from the diff. Use "approx" only as a last resort when the diff does not expose exact lines.
- One bullet per unique issue; do not duplicate an issue across sections.
- Keep the whole comment under ~300 words.

Format exactly:
<1-2 sentence summary of intent and top-level verdict>

Must-fix:
- <issue> - <brief why> - <file:line-range> - Action: <one-line action>
Nice-to-have:
- <issue> - <brief why> - <file:line-range> - Action: <one-line action>

Must-fix:

Nice-to-have:

Process:
- First classify the issue type (bug / feature request / question/support / refactor / ops) and state it as: Type: <one label>.
- Gather any needed repository context (code, config, docs) to validate assumptions.
- After gathering, if anything is still unclear or cannot be verified, do not speculate — state what's missing and ask targeted questions.
- Clarifying-question routing is best-effort, but when you need to ask clarifying questions, always use the structured question tool. Send 2–3 related questions in a single call by populating the questions[] array. Never ask clarifying questions as free-form chat text.

Mode selection by type:
- Bug / Question/Support / Ops: deliver the response directly using the matching template below. Do not bombard me with questions for straightforward diagnosis; use "Missing info" / "Repro/diagnostics needed" fields instead.
- Feature request / Refactor with substantive unknowns: this is effectively a planning session. Do not emit the Feature template on the first turn. Instead, ask me focused clarifying questions in batches of at most 3, one topic at a time (scope, constraints, tradeoffs, UX, etc.), wait for answers, drop questions that became irrelevant, and repeat until you have no more substantive questions. Only then emit the Feature template.

Output rules:
- Compact output; pick ONE template below and omit the others.
- No emojis. No code snippets. No fenced blocks.
- Short inline code identifiers allowed.
- Reference evidence with file paths and line ranges when applicable; if exact lines are not available, cite the file and say "approx" + why.
- Keep the entire response under ~300 words (applies to the final template output, not to clarifying-question turns).

Templates (choose one):
Bug:
- Summary (1-2 sentences)
- Likely cause (max 2)
- Repro/diagnostics needed (max 3)
- Fix approach (max 4 steps)
- Verification (max 3)

Feature:
- Summary (1-2 sentences)
- Requirements (max 4)
- Unknowns/questions (max 4)
- Proposed plan (max 5 steps)
- Verification (max 3)

Question/Support:
- Summary (1-2 sentences)
- Answer/guidance (max 6 lines)
- Missing info (max 4)

Final plan:
7. Once aligned, deliver the concrete implementation plan grounded in the repo context. Make remaining assumptions and missing context explicit.
8. Write the plan as ordinary markdown — no code fences, no plan.md wrapper. Use the actual plan name as the top heading, without an "Implementation Plan:" prefix. Use headings, lists, and bold for structure so the chat UI can render it as typeset prose. Organize phases so each phase contains multiple related implementation tasks; merge any phase that would contain only one task. Keep verification, acceptance criteria, files, and risks separate from actionable implementation tasks so task counts stay accurate. Emit the final plan and stop; the plan card provides the implementation action.`,

Report only real, high-signal issues introduced by these changes.

The diff is the source of truth. Use the local repo only as ancillary context when you need to validate a specific claim or check an applicable rule.

Focus on:
- runtime bugs
- incorrect logic
- broken assumptions in the changed code
- clear regressions introduced by the changes
- missing implementations across affected modules or targets when the diff clearly introduced the gap
- clear CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md violations that apply to the changed files

Do not report:
- pre-existing issues unrelated to the diff
- pedantic nitpicks a senior engineer would not flag
- issues a linter would catch
- subjective style preferences not explicitly required by CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md
- speculative concerns or anything you cannot verify with high confidence
- missing tests or coverage gaps unless an applicable CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md explicitly requires them for the changed area
- rules mentioned in CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md but explicitly silenced in the code

Validation pass:
- Before reporting an issue, re-check it against the diff plus only the local context you actually needed to read.
- For CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md violations, verify the rule applies to the affected file path and cite the exact rule.
- If you are not certain an issue is real, omit it.

Output:
- If no high-signal issues are found, respond with exactly: No high-signal issues found.
- Otherwise, return a concise numbered list.
- For each issue include:
  - short title
  - why it is a real problem
  - affected file path
  - category: bug or rule violation

Keep the review concise and practical.`,
