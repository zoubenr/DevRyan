## Responsibility
Shared UI primitives and wrappers (buttons, dialogs, menus, toasts, etc.).

## Design
Thin abstraction layer around Base UI/Radix/Hero patterns plus project styling defaults.

## Flow
Feature components compose these primitives and pass business logic via props/callbacks.

## Integration
Consumed across all UI domains; aligned with theme tokens and typography utilities.
