# packages/web/server/lib/ui-auth/

## Responsibility
UI authentication and session security layer: login/session JWT cookies, passkey integration, trusted-device TTL handling, and brute-force rate limiting.

## Design
- **Controller factory** (`createUiAuth`) encapsulates auth state and exposes middleware-like helpers.
- **Rate-limiter with per-key locks** prevents concurrent mutation races in in-memory attempt counters.
- **Session-token contract**: signed JWT in cookie (`oc_ui_session`) with secure-request-aware cookie policy.
- **Passkey submodule** (`ui-passkeys.js`) isolates WebAuthn credential operations.

## Flow
1. Login request enters rate-limit gate and credential/passkey verification path.
2. On success, module issues session cookie/JWT and clears limiter state.
3. Protected routes call `ensureSessionToken`/token readers for auth context.
4. Periodic cleanup prunes stale rate-limit records and lockout entries.

## Integration
- Consumed by notification/push/session routes and core auth/access route registrars.
- Uses JOSE for JWT signing/verification and local config files for auth persistence.
- Provides session identity primitive used across server and UI runtime APIs.
