## Responsibility
GitHub integration boundary: account auth storage/activation, OAuth device flow, Octokit client creation, and repository URL resolution.

## Design
- **Barrel exports** (`index.js`) expose stable GitHub operations to the rest of server runtime.
- **Auth split**:
  - `auth.js`: persisted auth accounts/tokens + active account switching
  - `device-flow.js`: OAuth device-code start/exchange
- **Repository parsing module** under `repo/` decouples remote URL normalization from auth logic.

## Flow
1. UI/CLI triggers login or repo inspection API route.
2. Device-flow helpers obtain token; auth module stores/activates credentials.
3. `octokit.js` returns scoped client when auth exists.
4. Repo resolver parses git remotes to owner/repo identifiers for status/PR operations.

## Integration
- Consumed by Git routes and GitHub-specific endpoints in server runtime.
- Downstream dependency for UI GitHub settings and repo status actions.
- External integration with GitHub OAuth and REST APIs via Octokit.
