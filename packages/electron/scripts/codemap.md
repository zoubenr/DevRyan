# packages/electron/scripts/

## Responsibility
Holds Electron-specific build/packaging helper scripts used by npm/bun tasks.

## Design
Script-first utilities (small Node/shell entrypoints) that run outside runtime code. They orchestrate packaging steps and release metadata, not app behavior.

## Flow
1. Workspace script invokes a helper in this folder.
2. Helper reads local package/release inputs.
3. Helper emits artifacts or metadata consumed by Electron build/release jobs.

## Integration
- Upstream callers: root `package.json` scripts and CI release workflows.
- Related runtime: `packages/electron/main.mjs` and `packages/web/server/*` (server-in-process model).
- Desktop policy: Electron is primary; Tauri scripts remain legacy-only in `packages/desktop/scripts`.
