## Responsibility
VS Code extension-host implementation: activation lifecycle, command surface, webview providers, OpenCode process management, and bridge runtime handlers.

## Design
- `extension.ts` is the orchestrator entrypoint.
- Provider classes (`ChatViewProvider`, `SessionEditorPanelProvider`, `AgentManagerPanelProvider`) encapsulate webview setup and host↔webview synchronization.
- `bridge.ts` is a dispatcher that routes message types to focused runtime modules (`bridge-fs-runtime`, `bridge-git-runtime`, `bridge-system-runtime`, etc.).
- `opencode.ts` provides a manager object with explicit connection status and restart/start/stop APIs.
- `opencodeConfig.ts` owns VS Code-side config entity reads/writes, OpenCode Slim config/agent override parity, Slim-installed global agent prompt composition, and managed agent runtime overlays so saved user-side agent model defaults apply to the local OpenCode process.
- `bridge-system-runtime.ts` owns VS Code Cursor SDK auth/status/configure bridge behavior via `@openchamber/cursor-sdk-runtime`; Cursor usage quota remains in `quotaProviders.ts`.

## Flow
1. Extension activates and creates OpenCode manager.
2. View providers register and load generated webview HTML.
3. Webview requests arrive as bridge messages.
4. Router resolves handler, executes operation, returns typed response.
5. Host pushes connection/theme/session updates back into webviews.

## Integration
- **Upstream runtime**: OpenCode CLI/server plus Cursor SDK for `cursor-acp` auth/status operations.
- **Downstream UI**: `packages/vscode/webview` bundle + shared `@openchamber/ui` contracts.
- **Host APIs**: VS Code commands, workspace filesystem, webview messaging, editor context.
